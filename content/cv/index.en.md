### 🇺🇸 Nevados - Frontend developer

**Period:** Feburary 2019 - December 2019 (11 months)

**Thechnologies:** React, React Native, TypeScript, NodeJS

**Country:** United States

**Links:** [Website](https://nevados.co/)

Nevados is a system for creating and managing solar power plants. It is comprised of two parts: hardware that physically adjusts the angle and rotation of solar panels, and software for remote control. Customers can register in the system, then use a map to delineate their site. Subsequently, an algorithm calculates the optimal placement, orientation, and quantity of the panels.

The main challenge lay in developing an algorithm to compute the optimal positions. All calculations occur directly in the browser and are written in TypeScript. I designed an algorithm that, utilizing extensive geometry, performed all the necessary computations.

Additionally, I created a mobile application in React Native. This app allows operators to scan the QR code on the solar panel control device, adding it to their control system.

**Results:** the system was put into operation and the mobile application was published on Google Play.

### 🇺🇸 Pando - Software engineer

**Period:** March 2016 - November 2018 (2 years, 9 months)

**Technologies:** AngularJS, NodeJS, Raspberry, RabbitMQ, AWS, Raspbian.

**Country:** United States

**Links:** [Website](http://getpando.com/)

Pando is a device built on Raspberry Pi that enables users to customize the content displayed on a connected screen via a web panel. Equipped with a WiFi module, the device scans its surroundings and analyzes the quantity of active devices in its proximity. Pando's primary usage is in retail spaces like shops and shopping centers.

My responsibility in this project involved writing the device control code and developing a web-based control panel using AngularJS. However, the Raspberry Pi, with its relatively limited power for media operations, presented certain challenges. Attempting to play content in a browser resulted in video glitches and freezes, which called for optimizing the Raspbian operating system to enhance media playback.

Updating the device's firmware also posed a challenge. It was crucial to ensure that new updates did not compromise the functionality of the device, as this would necessitate the manual installation of new firmware on all customer devices. Consequently, we paid special attention to the update process. We established a system that downloads and runs new firmware but automatically reverts to the prior version in the event of critical errors.

**Results:** the project was finalized and successfully launched.

### 🇺🇦 Hromadske.Kremenchuk - Chief Technology Officer

**Period:** February 2014 - May 2017 (3 years, 4 months)

**Technologies:** React, Angular, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, TypeScript, Electron, C++, PHP, WordPress, Nginx, RTMP.

**Country:** Ukraine

Hromadske TV, a non-governmental organization, was established in late 2013 with a clear mission: to provide accurate and unbiased event coverage, adhering to the highest journalistic standards. The organization took the form of a "public entity" to facilitate funding through donations and grants. It gained substantial traction during the Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine in 2014. The initial foundation was laid in Kyiv, which later expanded strategically to independent regional branches, one of which is in Kremenchuk.

I was brought onboard with the challenge of building a TV studio and its entire associated infrastructure from scratch, on a highly constrained budget. Typically, a TV studio is constructed using specialized equipment such as camera switchers, on-air video launchers, ticker tapes, Skype call handlers, and distinct devices for internet video streaming. However, given our budget limitations, we had to seek innovative alternatives. We decided to substitute traditional hardware with software solutions as much as possible. As a result, the preliminary version of the live broadcasting studio was comprised of merely a single computer equipped with a video stream capture card, supplemented with cameras and a sound mixer.

I developed our distinct web-based TV studio management system, which included:

- Title generation for broadcasts that aligned with our brand design, along with a database of individuals who had appeared on our broadcasts.
- A continuously updating, on-air ticker tape that journalists could edit remotely, leveraging WebSockets for real-time updates.
- A social media news publisher. This feature allowed journalists to create a news item and distribute it across all social platforms where Hromadske TV had a presence, all with a single click.

The server-side of our application was built using NodeJS and the Sails.js framework, while AngularJS was employed for the front-end development.

Later, I developed a standalone application on Electron, named Streamer. This application, intended to generate television broadcasts, was split into two windows. The first window functioned as a calendar, allowing easy scheduling of videos, live broadcasts, and advertisements while showing what was currently playing on-air. The second window served as a broadcast playback window, which was then captured by the computer and broadcasted on-air.

In a bid to further economize, I created custom devices. For example, I designed a device to illuminate the active camera. When a camera is selected for broadcasting, a red LED light above it is activated, guiding journalists where to focus. Comparable devices in the market usually cost between $200-$300, while our custom-built solution cost only $10.

**Results:** A fully functional TV studio was built from scratch at a fraction of the usual cost. I was responsible for setting up the studio and defining the processes and procedures for the technical team. Moreover, a TV website and a live broadcast management system were successfully launched.

### 🇺🇦 Visnyk Kremenchuka - iOS, PHP developer

**Period:** September 2012 - May 2014 (1 year, 8 months)

**Technologies:** iOS, Objective-C, Wordpress, PHP, MySQL

**Country:** Ukraine

Visnyk Kremenchuk is a media outlet based in Kremenchuk city. At the start of our collaboration, they were focused on publishing a weekly paper newspaper, while also maintaining a website. However, as the internet's influence intensified, they experienced a decline in their paper edition sales, contrasted with an increase in their website readership. This led to a strategic decision to prioritize their online presence.

Initially, I migrated their website to WordPress from an outdated CMS, which hadn't seen any updates for a significant period. Transitioning to WordPress offered a more visually appealing platform for content creation, simplified the news editing process, enhanced content management, and provided access to detailed analytics. Apache and Nginx were utilized for load balancing, and we introduced the functionality to cache pages into static files for improved performance.

Following this, the editorial team made the decision to expand their digital footprint with an iOS application. The core functionalities of this application included news reading, commenting capability, photo and video viewing, and saving of favorite content. To meet these requirements, I developed the application in Objective-C and seamlessly integrated it with the existing website through the WordPress API and custom plugins I developed.

**Results:** The website's loading speed saw a fourfold increase, dramatically enhancing user experience. Additionally, the app was successfully published on the App Store and has attracted approximately a thousand users.

### 🇺🇦 RiverSoft - Delphi, C# developer

**Period:** March 2010 - May 2012 (2 years, 2 months)

**Technologies:** Delphi, C#, WPF, Microsoft SQL Server

**Country:** Ukraine

RiverSoft is a company that specializes in the development of automated parking systems. Initially, my responsibility was to enhance an existing parking management system that was constructed using Delphi.

As time progressed, we were given the task of developing an interface for parking machines, a tool that customers would utilize for paying their parking fees and replenishing their cards. It was during this period that we chose to transition to Microsoft technologies, specifically utilizing C#, the .NET framework, and SQL Server. The interface for the parking meters was developed with WPF. This decision turned out to be prudent as the Microsoft stack enabled us to deploy the system rapidly. With the use of WPF and XAML, we were able to modify the interface's appearance with considerable flexibility.

**Results:** following the transition to an automated system, cash theft by employees was completely eliminated. This significant change directly led to a doubling of the client's profits.
